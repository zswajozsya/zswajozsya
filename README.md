# Žwajožya

Žwajožya is a label-based file manager.

The name Žwajožya (pronounced /ʒwadʒoʒja/) comes from the language [New Ithkuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil), meaning "something that based on label". Its ASCII-friendly romanization is Zswajozsya, and therefore you simply call it "Zsw".
